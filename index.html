      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an Art Historian that focuses mainly in Ancient Roman Art and conservation science. I am also a fitness instructor and teach a variety of yoga, pilates and HIIT classes.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Durham, North Carolina</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Exercising, painting, traveling, spending time with my friends/family and people watching</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm not quite sure yet! I'd love to do something that involved web development or data science, art conservation and history and environmental conservation as well.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I am back in Durham for the time being, but look forward to new adventures when life starts to move into a new normal.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've mainly worked in the field, in labs or a studio and have enjoyed that time but I am ready for something new. I've done work in the past with HTML and recently learned basic Python and really enjoyed both. I've been intimidated by technology but have always been interested in learning more and web development seemed the best way to jump in! </p>
